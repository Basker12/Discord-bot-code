Welcome to the Discord bot guide!

My first discord bot appropriately named Weenur pod, is a simple
bot that does simple things like show messages, show a persons ID
and even plays 8ball with you!

Learning the Discord API was really fun and i enjoyed myself learning
and writing the code for this bot. At first i thought it was going to be 
really difficult and challenging but honestly if you know a bit about 
Python (The bot can be written in other languages for example Java)
then you wont be having any problems. The API is 'ok' to read it
can be pretty challenging at times, but if you're ever stuck i 
highly recommend watching a video about it or just use StackOverflow.

| Improve the 'coin' feature | I added the coin feature when i started to code the bot and didn't really do anything else with it, but i want to add a shop where you can buy items with. | N |
| Embed all messages | This isn't really a feature but it does make the bots outputs of messages look a lot cleaner, unfortunately embeding these messages isn't hard or challenging its just very tedious to do. Thats why this is my least of my priorty to complete. | N | 
| Music | The music feature will let you play a song from YouTube by making the bot join the VC and playing the song and leave the VC when requested by the user. | N |

You can use the bots code to your liking but the Weenur Pod name is my use,
if someone wishes to use my bots name (Weenur Pod) they must message me on 
Discord.
