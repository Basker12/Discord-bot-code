My first discord bot appropriately named Weenur pod, is a simple
bot that does simple things like show messages, show a persons ID
and even plays 8ball with you!

Learning the Discord API was really fun and i enjoyed myself learning
and writing the code for this bot. At first i thought it was going to be 
really difficult and challenging but honestly if you know a bit about 
Python (The bot can be written in other languages for example Java)
then you wont be having any problems. The API is 'ok' to read it
can be pretty challenging at times, but if you're ever stuck i 
highly recommend watching a video about it or just use StackOverflow.

The bot will have new features added to it, i'll get rid of the coins feature.
The coins feature was just for me too expermient with what i can do with the 
code. 

Here are things that i will add to the bot and approximately when thet will be 
added. A added feature which will on the bot will be marked here with a **.

The bot too be able to join, leave and play music in a vc (voice channel)
^This will take around 2-3 days from now.

Remove the coin feature and replace it with another game, e.g. 8 ball or
something along those lines.
^This will take around 1-2 days from now. ** < Completed

Add a gaming quiz. < This one is for fun.

Maybe embed all of the bots messages but this is a tedious process so i might 
skip on it but it does make the bots code look a lot cleaner.
^There isn't really a time for this because of me not being bothered to go 
throught the boring process of embeding the messages.

You can use the bots code to your liking but the Weenur Pod name is my use,
if someone wishes to use my bots name (Weenur Pod) they must message me on 
Discord.

My discord is: Basker#8607

Thank you for reading, Basker12.
